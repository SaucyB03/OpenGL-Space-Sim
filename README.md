# M4OEP-bksoucy-kjablon4

##Bradon Soucy and Kamila Jablonowski
- GLFW, glm, OpenGL, std_image
- Our project is a space simulation that visualizes different planet sizes and speeds and see how they orbit. It demonstrates the  use of shaders, mouse and keyboard listeners, drawing of the planets, and use of timers.
- We have no known bugs as of now!
- In the future, we would've hoped to install that menu to make it more user friendly however had a hard time finding the ImGui - Clion connection. This would mean the users could implement their own planets with sizes, speeds, and textures themselves and see how it interacts with other planets. Unfortunately, we ran out of time to get this to fully function correctly.

- We think we deserve a 98 because of the amount of time and effort that was put into this! The use of multiple graphics programs and a clear 3D visualization of our projects potential and complex idea.
