## About Our Project:
This project is a semester-long OpenGL experience, slowly learning each of the intricate pieces along the way to display what you see in this code. Also, check out my other repos for my earlier OpenGL creations to see how I got here!

## What does it do?
This project allows you to create planets of varying size, texture, mass, spin, initial velocity, and initial position. Then when the program runs, it takes those inputs and calculates the trajectory, allowing you to simulate realistic planet / gravity-based simulations.

## The Future:
- Hope to add IMGUI to enable real-time editing and creation of planets to give it a more interactive feel.
- I also want to add toggleable planet tracers, that fade out after a set interval of time, allowing the user to watch the paths of the planets evolve over time.
